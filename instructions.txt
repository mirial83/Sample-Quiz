Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. 
As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, 
we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang 
attribute to your html element. This will assist screen 
readers in identifying the language of the page.

Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is 
used to specify information about the page, such as the 
title, description, keywords, and author.

Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset 
value.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of 
the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding 
supported by most browsers.
